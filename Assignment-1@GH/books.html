      The original Sherlock Holmes play written by Arthur Conan Doyle and William Gillette had a successful run of over 30 years. It has many original parts which are not found in the short stories but borrows many events from the canonical
      adventures, namely "A Scandal in Bohemia" and "The Adventure of the Final Problem". Also, it had elements from A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four, "The Boscombe Valley Mystery", "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", and "The Adventure of
      the Naval Treaty". It includes the very first mention of the phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson".[13][14] While Doyle wrote the original version, it is unclear how much of his material survived in the play as performed, which was written by
      Gillette. Doyle and Gillette later revised the play together; it has since been revised by others twice.
